# USB Type-Kay

<br>

A USB-A Hub powered by USB-C.

I made this powered USB Hub because I use a USB Hub at my desk, but not everything works correctly when it doesn't recieve all of the 500mA current. It would be much nicer if there was enough power such that each port could have the full power of a regular USB-A port.
